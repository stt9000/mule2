# Construct System Integration Test

## Test Instructions

To test that the construct system is properly integrated into the main game:

### 1. Start the Game
```bash
npm start
```
Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### 2. Start a New Game
- Click "New Game" on the main menu
- Select 2 players
- Start the game

### 3. Navigate to Construct Phase
The game will start in the territory selection phase. To reach the construct phase:
- Each player should claim a territory when their turn comes
- After all players have claimed territories, the game will advance to the construct phase

### 4. Test Construct Shop
During the construct phase, when it's a player's turn:
- Press 'C' to open the Construct Shop
- The shop should display:
  - List of available constructs (Mana Conduit, Vitality Well, Arcanum Extractor, Aether Resonator)
  - Resource costs for each construct
  - Production information
  - Player's available resources

### 5. Test Purchasing
- Click on a construct you can afford
- Click "Purchase" button
- Verify resources are deducted
- Verify construct appears in inventory

### 6. Test Placement
- After purchasing, click "Close" on the shop
- Click on one of your territories
- The placement interface should show:
  - Success rate percentage
  - Terrain bonus indicators
  - Installation preview

### 7. Test Installation
- Click "Install" to begin the installation ritual
- Watch the magical animation
- See the dice roll result
- Verify construct is placed on success

### 8. Test Management Panel
- Press 'M' to open the Construct Management panel
- Should show all your active constructs with:
  - Location
  - Efficiency
  - Production rate
  - Status

### 9. Test Production Monitor
- Press 'P' to toggle the Production Monitor
- Should show real-time resource production
- Updates when production cycles occur

## Expected Results

✓ Construct Shop opens with 'C' key
✓ Can purchase constructs with sufficient resources
✓ Placement mode highlights valid territories
✓ Installation animations play correctly
✓ Constructs appear on territories after successful installation
✓ Management panel shows all active constructs
✓ Production monitor displays resource generation
✓ Save/Load preserves construct data

## Integration Points Verified

1. **GameFlowController** - Initializes ConstructManager
2. **GameScene** - Initializes ConstructSystemIntegration
3. **ResourceProductionCalculator** - Calculates construct production
4. **Save/Load** - Serializes and deserializes construct data
5. **UI Systems** - All panels render and function correctly
6. **Event System** - Construct events propagate properly

## Known Issues

None at this time. The construct system is fully integrated into the main game.
