# Player 1 Construct Placement Test

## Test Overview
This test verifies that Player 1 can successfully claim territories and place constructs during their turn.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Territory Dispute Resolution
- Added `resolveDisputes()` call at the end of territory_selection phase in GameCycleManager
- Added logging to track territory ownership assignment
- Added visual update after phase ends to show territory ownership

### 2. Fixed Construct Placement for Player 1
- Fixed `upgradeTerritory` to use GameFlowController instead of window.gameState
- Fixed territory click handling to properly call upgradeTerritory during construct phase
- Added proper action execution through TurnManager when placing/upgrading constructs
- Fixed coordinate system to use axial coordinates for construct visuals

### 3. Fixed Turn Management
- Timer is properly skipped for Player 1 during interactive phases
- Players get 3 actions during construct_outfitting phase
- Actions are properly consumed when placing constructs

## Manual Test Steps

### Phase 1: Territory Selection
1. Start the game at http://localhost:8080
2. Observe "Phase: Territory Selection" in the UI
3. Click "Buy Land" button
4. Click on an unowned territory (should show "Territory selected! Will be resolved at end of phase")
5. Click "End Turn" to end Player 1's turn
6. Wait for AI players to select territories (watch for their selections)
7. After all players have selected, the phase should end and territories should be assigned

### Phase 2: Construct Outfitting
1. Observe "Phase: Construct Outfitting" in the UI
2. Verify it's Player 1's turn (check player name in UI)
3. Check that Player 1 has at least one territory (owned territories should have Player 1's color border)
4. Click "Upgrade Territory" button
5. Click on one of Player 1's territories
6. Verify:
   - A white circle appears on the territory (the construct)
   - Gold decreases by 200
   - Success message appears
   - Territory shows construct information when selected
7. If Player 1 has multiple territories and enough gold, repeat steps 4-6
8. Click "End Turn" when done

## Expected Results
- Player 1 should be able to claim territories in phase 1
- Territories should be properly assigned after dispute resolution
- Player 1 should be able to place constructs on their territories in phase 2
- Gold should decrease appropriately when placing constructs
- Visual feedback should appear (construct graphics)
- Turn should not end automatically after placing one construct

## Debug Information
The console will show:
- "Resolving territory disputes at end of territory selection phase"
- Territory ownership assignments
- Turn start/end information
- Action execution logs

## Known Issues Fixed
- Player 1's territories were not being properly assigned after dispute resolution
- Construct placement was using wrong player reference
- Turn was ending immediately after one action
- Visual updates were not showing territory ownership
