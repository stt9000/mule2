---

## ✅ **COMPLETED FIXES**

### **Issue #1: Save/Load Version Handling** *(HIGH PRIORITY)*
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Execution Time:** ~45 minutes

#### Changes Made:
- **Fixed GamePersistence.js:** Added version field to gameState in save data structure
- **Fixed GameStateManager.js:** Updated import logic to handle version in multiple locations for backward compatibility  
- **Fixed GameFlowController.js:** Corrected load method to pass proper data structure
- **Added version field:** Ensured version is included in initial game state

#### Verification:
- ✅ Save operations complete successfully with version information
- ✅ Load operations restore exact game state  
- ✅ Version validation works correctly
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

**Result:** Save/load functionality is now fully operational.

### **Issue #2: Turn Order Calculation** *(MEDIUM PRIORITY)*
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Execution Time:** ~30 minutes

#### Changes Made:
- **Fixed TurnManager.js:** Enhanced wealth calculation with debugging
- **Improved sort logic:** Added comprehensive turn order calculation with logging
- **Fixed GameStateManager.js:** Corrected player gold initialization to preserve input values
- **Added validation:** Ensured player index handling and tie-breaking

#### Verification:
- ✅ Turn order follows M.U.L.E. poorest-first rules correctly
- ✅ Diana (600g) → Bob (800g) → Charlie (1000g) → Alice (1200g)
- ✅ Wealth calculation includes all components (gold, territories, constructs)
- ✅ Tie-breaking works with player index

**Result:** Turn order now correctly implements M.U.L.E. mechanics.

---

### **Issue #3: Timer Event Broadcasting** *(MEDIUM PRIORITY)*
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Execution Time:** ~45 minutes

#### Changes Made:
- **Fixed method naming:** Renamed `updateTimer()` to `updateSingleTimer()` to avoid conflicts
- **Enhanced debugging:** Added comprehensive logging throughout timer system
- **Improved event broadcasting:** Added detailed event tracking and error handling
- **Fixed timer lifecycle:** Improved timer expiration and cleanup processes

#### Verification:
- ✅ Timer start events fire correctly
- ✅ Timer update events fire every second
- ✅ Timer expiration events fire when timers complete
- ✅ Event data includes correct timer information
- ✅ Pause/resume functionality works properly

**Result:** Timer event system now provides complete UI feedback.
