Technical Implementation Notes for Claude Code

Progressive Development:

Start with simplified versions of each system
Use Claude Code to gradually refine and expand functionality
Build core systems first, then add visual polish


Component-Based Architecture:

Design with modular components
Use inheritance and composition patterns
Maintain separation between game logic and visualization


Testing Approach:

Test each component in isolation
Create automated tests for economic formulas
Build visualization tools to verify system behavior


Recommended Technologies:

Frontend: JavaScript with Phaser.js or PixiJS
Data Management: JSON for game data
Graphics: Vector-based SVG for UI, sprite sheets for game elements
Sound: Web Audio API with howler.js


Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Focus:

First build a working territory and resource system
Then implement basic auctions
Add visual polish incrementally



This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap from concept to completed game, with each phase building on the previous ones. Claude Code can help implement each component step by step, allowing you to gradually build the complete "Magical Frontiers" game while maintaining quality and coherence throughout the development process.
