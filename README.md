# Magical Frontiers: M.U.L.E. Reimagined in Fantasy

A web-based fantasy reimagining of the classic economic strategy game M.U.L.E.

## Game Description

Magical Frontiers transforms M.U.L.E.'s innovative economic system into a fantasy setting through magical territories, mystical resources, and arcane constructs while preserving its brilliant supply-demand dynamics. This framework replaces M.U.L.E.'s sci-fi colonization with magical realm development, using enchanted territories to produce magical essences that power a dynamic fantasy economy with the same elegant balance of competition and cooperation.
